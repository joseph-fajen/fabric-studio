# Session Summary - 2025-07-21 (Session 01)

## Accomplishments
- **Session handoff optimization**: Updated .claude/commands/session-handoff.md to organize SESSION-SUMMARY files in session-summaries/ folder
- **Removed inefficient validation step**: Eliminated Step 3 (State Validation) that was time-consuming with minimal value
- **Streamlined workflow**: Reduced from 6-step to 5-step process for faster handoffs
- **Filename collision prevention**: Implemented auto-incrementing session numbers (SESSION-SUMMARY-YYYY-MM-DD-01.md, -02.md, etc.)
- **Template improvements**: Added structured session summary template with organized sections
- **Git cleanup**: Migrated existing session summaries to new folder structure

## Current Status
- YouTube Fabric Processor: Operational with 70-second processing target
- Session handoff command: Optimized and streamlined (5 steps vs 6)
- File organization: SESSION-SUMMARY files now properly organized in session-summaries/
- Git repository: Clean state with session handoff improvements committed

## Next Session Priorities
- Test new auto-incrementing filename logic with multiple same-day sessions
- Review other workflow commands for similar efficiency improvements
- Continue optimizing processing performance
- Maintain documentation updates as workflows improve

## Configuration Notes
- Fabric CLI integration: Operational with transcript-first approach
- Processing mode: transcript-first → CLI → simulation fallback hierarchy
- API keys: Configure via Reef Laboratory Console for fallback providers
- Dependencies: fabric, yt-dlp required for full functionality

## Quick-start Commands
```bash
# Test system status
npm start &
sleep 3
curl http://localhost:3000/health
pkill -f "node server.js"

# Verify dependencies
which fabric yt-dlp
fabric --version
```
