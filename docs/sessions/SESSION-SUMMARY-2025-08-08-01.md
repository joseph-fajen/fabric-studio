# Session Summary - 2025-08-08 (Session 01)

## Accomplishments

### Railway Deployment Debugging & Critical Fixes
- **Log Analysis**: Analyzed colleague's Railway deployment test logs revealing three critical production issues
- **PayloadTooLargeError Resolution**: Fixed Express JSON parser limit issue preventing large transcript uploads
  - Increased limit from default 100kb to 15mb in `server.js:29`
  - Enables processing of substantial transcript files in production
- **Fabric CLI Command Failures Fixed**: Resolved path detection issues for Railway deployment
  - Added `/go/bin/fabric` as priority path in `src/core/fabric-transcript-integration.js:44`
  - Enhanced error logging for better debugging of fabric CLI execution
- **Download Endpoint Enhancement**: Fixed RangeNotSatisfiableError for file serving
  - Added file size validation and proper HTTP headers in `server.js:652-671`
  - Prevents corrupted or empty ZIP file downloads

## Current Status

### Fabric Studio Production Readiness
- **Universal Content Processing**: Main branch optimized for cloud deployment (Railway, Heroku, AWS)
- **Processing Performance**: Target 70-second processing time maintained
- **Fabric CLI Integration**: Enhanced path detection with Railway-specific fixes
- **API Fallback Hierarchy**: 4-model fallback system (Claude Sonnet → Haiku → older models)

### Fixed Railway Deployment Issues
1. ✅ **Large File Upload Support**: 15mb limit now supports substantial transcripts
2. ✅ **Fabric CLI Path Resolution**: Proper detection of `/go/bin/fabric` on Railway
3. ✅ **Download Reliability**: Enhanced ZIP file serving with validation and headers

## Next Session Priorities

### Immediate Testing & Validation
1. **Railway Deployment Testing**: Deploy and verify all three fixes work in production environment
2. **End-to-End Workflow Testing**: Test complete transcript upload → processing → download workflow
3. **Large File Processing**: Validate 10-15mb transcript files process without timeout issues
4. **API Key Configuration**: Test fabric CLI model fallback hierarchy with actual API keys on Railway

### Performance & Monitoring
1. **Processing Time Baseline**: Establish performance metrics post-fixes
2. **Error Monitoring**: Monitor Railway logs for any remaining edge cases
3. **WebSocket Stability**: Test real-time progress updates during long processing sessions

### Potential Issues to Monitor
- Fabric CLI authentication configuration in Railway environment
- ZIP file creation performance with large processing results  
- Memory usage optimization for concurrent large transcript processing

## Configuration Notes

### Railway Environment Variables Required
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`: Primary model for fabric CLI
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Fallback models (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini)
- `ADMIN_MODE`: Set to `false` for production security
- `NODE_ENV`: Set to `production`

### Processing Mode Status
- **Primary Mode**: Transcript-first approach with fabric CLI (fixed path detection)
- **Fallback**: 4-model hierarchy with exponential backoff retry logic
- **Emergency Mode**: Simulation mode if fabric CLI unavailable

## Quick-start Commands

### Context Restoration Commands
```bash
# Check system status
npm start &
sleep 3
curl http://localhost:3000/health
curl http://localhost:3000/api/management/status

# Verify fabric CLI path detection
fabric --version
which fabric

# Test processing pipeline with sample transcript
ls outputs/ | head -5

# Stop server when done testing
pkill -f "node server.js"
```

### Railway Deployment Testing
```bash
# Deploy to Railway and test fixes
railway up
railway logs --tail=50

# Test large file upload (>5mb transcript)
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"contentType":"transcript","transcript":"[large_content]"}' \
  https://your-app.railway.app/api/process

# Test download endpoint
curl -I https://your-app.railway.app/api/download/{processId}
```
