# Session Handoff Procedure

Execute the comprehensive 5-step session handoff procedure for maintaining development context and momentum across AI assistant sessions for the Fabric Studio.

## Instructions

Follow the systematic 5-step process for seamless session transitions:

### Step 1: Progress Assessment
Document what was accomplished in this session:
- Processing optimizations or feature implementations
- Fabric integration improvements or fixes
- Web interface enhancements or bug fixes
- Performance testing results and metrics
- Architecture decisions and rationale
- Pattern execution issues resolved

### Step 2: Documentation Updates
Update project documentation to reflect current state:
- Modify README.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, or CLAUDE.md
- Update fabric pattern configurations or processing methods
- Record new dependencies, API requirements, or setup procedures
- Document performance improvements and benchmarks
- Capture transcript-first architecture decisions
- Update troubleshooting guides with new solutions

### Step 3: Next Session Preparation
Document specific next steps and priorities:
- YouTube processing improvements or optimizations needed
- Fabric pattern additions or modifications
- Web interface enhancements or bug fixes
- Performance testing with specific video types
- Integration improvements (transcript downloaders, parallel processing)
- Server management features to implement
- API endpoint additions or modifications
- Documentation gaps to address

### Step 4: Handoff Summary
Create comprehensive transition document in docs/sessions folder:
```bash
# Create docs/sessions folder if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p docs/sessions

# Create session summary with current date and session number
DATE=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
SESSION_NUM=1
while [ -f "docs/sessions/SESSION-SUMMARY-${DATE}-$(printf "%02d" $SESSION_NUM).md" ]; do
    SESSION_NUM=$((SESSION_NUM + 1))
done
FILENAME="docs/sessions/SESSION-SUMMARY-${DATE}-$(printf "%02d" $SESSION_NUM).md"

cat > "$FILENAME" << 'EOF'
# Session Summary - ${DATE} (Session $(printf "%02d" $SESSION_NUM))

## Accomplishments
- [Document what was accomplished in this session]

## Current Status
- Current Fabric Studio status and recent changes
- Processing performance metrics (current ~70s target)
- Fabric CLI integration status and any issues

## Next Session Priorities
- Immediate priorities for next session
- Known issues with fabric patterns or transcript processing

## Configuration Notes
- Any API key or configuration requirements
- Processing mode fallback status (transcript-first â†’ CLI â†’ simulation)

## Quick-start Commands
- Quick-start commands for context restoration

```

Document should include:
- Current Fabric Studio status and recent changes
- Processing performance metrics (current ~70s target)
- Fabric CLI integration status and any issues
- Immediate priorities for next session
- Known issues with fabric patterns or transcript processing
- Quick-start commands for context restoration
- Any API key or configuration requirements
- Processing mode fallback status (transcript-first â†’ CLI â†’ simulation)

### Step 5: Git Status Cleanup & Commit Optimization
Ensure clean repository state after all files have been written:
```bash
# Check git status
git status

# Review recent commits
git log --oneline -5

# If uncommitted changes exist:
git diff --name-only
git add [relevant-files]
git commit -m "session handoff: [description of changes made]

## Expected Outcome

A complete session handoff summary providing:
- Clear record of session accomplishments
- Updated documentation reflecting current processing capabilities
- Clean git repository state
- Prepared next session startup with fabric context
- Comprehensive handoff documentation
- Performance benchmarks and optimization status

## Quick Context Restoration Commands

For next session startup:
```bash
# Check system status
npm start &
sleep 3
curl http://localhost:3000/health
curl http://localhost:3000/api/management/status

# Test processing pipeline
fabric --version
yt-dlp --version
ls outputs/ | head -5

# Stop server when done testing
pkill -f "node server.js"
```

This procedure ensures seamless continuity between AI assistant sessions and maintains development momentum for the high-performance YouTube video analysis application.
